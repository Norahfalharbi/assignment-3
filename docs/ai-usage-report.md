## Tools Used & Use Cases

**ChatGPT**  
- Helped debug JavaScript sorting logic (A–Z and date sorting).
- Assisted in restructuring my script to fix scope and variable reference errors.
- Suggested replacing the greeting `alert()` with a toast-style notification.
- Helped refine the filter + search + sort functionality so they work together.
- Reviewed CSS for `.projects-grid` and suggested cleaning unused rules.
- Provided guidance for implementing the timer and improving localStorage usage.

## Benefits & Challenges

### **Benefits**
- Saved time while debugging and testing multiple JavaScript features.
- Improved understanding of DOM manipulation, sorting, and event handling.
- Helped me identify and remove redundant or conflicting CSS rules.
- Provided clear explanations that made improving my code easier.

### **Challenges**
- Some suggestions contained extra or unnecessary code that I removed.
- Needed to adjust AI suggestions to match the structure of my website.
- Had to test combined features (filter, search, sort, toast) to avoid conflicts.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to combine search, filtering, and sorting into an interactive UI.
- Understood how to store and retrieve user preferences using `localStorage`.
- Learned how to create a small toast message with CSS and JavaScript.
- Improved debugging skills for DOM events and scoping issues.
- Gained experience using the Google Books API and handling errors.

## How I Used AI Responsibly
- I reviewed every suggestion and kept only what fit the assignment.
- I first wrote the main functionality myself, then used AI to improve it.
- Used AI mainly for debugging, clarifying concepts, and refining my code.
- Ensured the final work reflects my own structure, design, and implementation.
