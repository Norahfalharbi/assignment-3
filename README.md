# Protfolio website

# Overview
This is my homework for Assignment-3. It is an enhanced, interactive portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The project focuses on applying advanced JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, localStorage, event handling, dynamic rendering, API usage, timers, and sorting/filtering logic.

# Objective
The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Build an interactive, user-friendly web interface.
- Implement advanced JavaScript features beyond basic DOM manipulation.
- Handle API data, state management, and user personalization.
- Organize a complete front-end project with clean structure and documentation.

# Description
The website includes:

- **A personalized greeting using time-based logic**  
- **A toast notification instead of an alert**  
- **A timer that tracks how long the user has been on the page**  
- **A project section that supports filtering, searching, and sorting (by date or A–Z)**  
- **A light/dark theme switcher saved using localStorage**  
- **A section loading programming books from the Google Books API**  
- **A contact form with built-in browser validation and custom messages**

# Features
- Time-based personalized greeting  
- Toast notification system  
- Light/Dark theme switcher 
- Project filtering by type  
- Live search bar  
- Sorting projects by A–Z or date 
- Expandable project details section  
- Google Books API integration
